# 📊 Plotly Navigator 🚀  
*Your data. Your vibe. Your plot.*

Welcome to **Plotly Navigator** — a zero-code, all-fun data viz playground for analysts, students, and anyone who loves turning spreadsheets into stories.

## 🎯 What It Does  
Upload your CSV or Excel file, and *BOOM!*  
Instantly explore:
- 🔍 Distributions (Histograms, Box Plots, Violin, ECDFs)
- 🧩 Relationships (Scatter, Bar, Violin, Box)
- 🧠 Time trends (line charts with smart date handling)
- 🌈 Category breakdowns (sweet sweet pie charts)
- 🪐 Multi-dimensional madness (correlation heatmaps, bubble charts, pair plots)

It’s like Tableau, but Streamlit-powered, Plotly-stylized, and snack-sized.

## 🧠 Who Is It For?  
- You love clicking more than coding.
- You have data, but not the time to build charts from scratch.
- You appreciate a tooltip that says “Layman’s Interpretation.”
